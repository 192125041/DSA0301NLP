    Textual coherence is an essential aspect of effective writing. It helps readers follow the logical flow of ideas within a text. However, achieving coherence can be challenging. Therefore, writers often use transitional words and phrases. In addition, maintaining a consistent topic and theme throughout a text is vital. For example, in a persuasive essay, it's crucial to use persuasive language consistently. In conclusion, evaluating coherence is an important step in assessing the quality of a text.
